Today, I'm going to demonstrate how to leverage CockroachDB with MIT Kerberos and the Django project. We have a lot of customers using us for their Python database needs and you can view some of the options on our [docs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/build-a-python-app-with-cockroachdb-django.html) site.
For today's setup, I have a multi-node CockroachDB cluster, a Django container calles web, a load balancer container and Kerberos kdc container. You can find the code for this example on my [repo](https://github.com/dbist/cockroach-docker/tree/master/cockroach-gssapi-django). My example is a slight modification of the one you can find from [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/django/).

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dbist/cockroach-docker
cd cockroach-docker/cockroach-gssapi-django
```

1. Create a django project
 
As I said, my version is a bit different from the one on the Docker website, as I'm adding a Kerberos Distribution Center, a load balancer and a three node CockroachDB cluster. Otherwise pretty much everything else is the same. What does not work is creating a project via the container like in the Docker quickstart. So `docker-compose run web django-admin startproject composeexample .` won't work as I have additional adding an entrypoint in my Django container to kinit to the kdc. This is a small price to pay so instead, we're going to run this manually.

a) Install Django locally

```bash
pip3 install django==2.2
```

```bash
Collecting django==2.2
  Using cached Django-2.2-py3-none-any.whl (7.4 MB)
Requirement already satisfied: pytz in /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from django==2.2) (2020.1)
Requirement already satisfied: sqlparse in /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from django==2.2) (0.3.1)
Installing collected packages: django
  Attempting uninstall: django
    Found existing installation: Django 3.1
    Uninstalling Django-3.1:
      Successfully uninstalled Django-3.1
Successfully installed django-2.2
```

Django 2.2 is the current long term release but this setup works with Django 3.0 and 3.1 as well and I'll cover that in a bit.

b) Create a project

In the root of the docker-compose directory, initialize a new Django project

```bash
django-admin startproject example .
```

Now you should see a directory called example and a file called manage.py.

2. Edit the django properties file

edit the example/settings.py with the following properties

```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
```

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django_cockroachdb',
        'NAME': 'defaultdb',
        'USER': 'tester',
        'HOST': 'lb',
        'PORT': '26257',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'sslmode': 'verify-full',
            'sslrootcert': '/certs/ca.crt',
        },
    },
}
```

This is not much different from the standard Django properties except for the following subtle differences. 

`ENGINE` is our cockroachdb native driver for Django, `NAME` is the database name, `USER` is a user in our Kerberos KDC, `HOST` points to our load balancer instance, please review the previous articles if you need further context on that. We also include `sslmode` and `sslrootcert` to verify the authenticity of our clients and nodes.

3. Verify the requirements file has the proper version of Django and cockroachdb driver.

```bash
cd ./django
vi requirements.txt
```

Uncomment the desired versions of Django and cockroachdb driver.

4. Run `./up.sh` script to start the environment

```bash
./up.sh
cockroach uses an image, skipping
Building roach-cert
Step 1/15 : FROM cockroachdb/cockroach:v20.1.4 AS generator
 ---> 25bee4f016c4
...
SET CLUSTER SETTING

Time: 8.1053ms
```

5. Check to make sure all containers are up

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

```bash
kdc          /start.sh                        Up
lb           /docker-entrypoint.sh hapr ...   Up      0.0.0.0:26257->26257/tcp,
                                                      5432/tcp,
                                                      0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp,
                                                      0.0.0.0:8081->8081/tcp
roach-0      /cockroach/cockroach.sh st ...   Up      26257/tcp, 8080/tcp
roach-1      /cockroach/cockroach.sh st ...   Up      26257/tcp, 8080/tcp
roach-2      /cockroach/cockroach.sh st ...   Up      26257/tcp, 8080/tcp
roach-cert   /bin/sh -c tail -f /dev/null     Up
web          /start.sh python manage.py ...   Up      0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp
```

6. Inspect the logs for the web container

```bash
docker logs web
```

```bash
Watching for file changes with StatReloader
Performing system checks...

You have 17 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.
Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.
August 07, 2020 - 19:41:52
Django version 2.2.15, using settings 'example.settings'
Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

We can see the server is up, we can navigate to the Django [portal](http://localhost:8000/) from your host.

I had a customer ask how to pass a custom SPN to Django project. It was not documented and not so intuitive but after some trial and error, the following was achieved by addition of the `krbsrvname` to the example/settings.py file.

7. Django with custom SPN

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django_cockroachdb',
        'NAME': 'defaultdb',
        'USER': 'tester',
        'HOST': 'lb',
        'PORT': '26257',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'sslmode': 'verify-full',
            'sslrootcert': '/certs/ca.crt',
            'krbsrvname': 'customspn',
        },
    },
}
```

Tear down the environment with a helper script called `./down.sh` and restart it with `./up.sh`. 

```bash
You have 17 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.
Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.
August 07, 2020 - 19:55:59
Django version 2.2.15, using settings 'example.settings'
Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

Let's apply those migrations!

8. Apply migration

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

```bash
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions

  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK

  Applying auth.0010_alter_group_name_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions... OK
  Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
```

9. Upgrade Django

There are many [reasons](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/upgrade-version/) to upgrade Django. Let's do that with our project.

We need to edit our `django/requirements.txt` file to match the target version of Django, in our case 3.1.

```bash
# Django 3.1
Django>=3.1.*
django-cockroachdb>=3.1.*
```

Tear down the environment with down.sh and start it up again with up.sh. Navigate to the django portal and you will see the new version.

PLACEHOLDER django_3.1

And just so there are no doubts, let's connect to the web container and see whether connection has been made with Kerberos

```bash
docker exec -ti web sh
klist
```

```bash
Default principal: tester@EXAMPLE.COM

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
08/07/20 20:11:20  08/08/20 20:11:20  krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@EXAMPLE.COM
	renew until 08/07/20 20:11:20
08/07/20 20:11:31  08/08/20 20:11:20  customspn/lb@
	renew until 08/07/20 20:11:20
08/07/20 20:11:31  08/08/20 20:11:20  customspn/lb@EXAMPLE.COM
	renew until 08/07/20 20:11:20
```

That's it for today, hope you enjoyed this tour of Django with Kerberos.
